# Project Name

SafeSpace

## Heading

Web-platform where users can interact with each other in a safe space, share their stories and experiences, and support one another.

## Sub-Heading

SafeSpace is targeted to people seeking a community where it is safe to share traumatic experiences with others who can relate.

## Summary

Many people have had traumatic events occur in their life that lingers with them for years. Being unable to share how we feel, or not having the resources to do so with professionals, we risk having to deal with these experiences on our own. SafeSpace provides a platform for individuals seeking a safe community where they can share their feelings and experiences. A place that they can find relief and talk to those who can relate.

## Problem

Surviving a traumatic experience can often be isolating, which can make the healing process that much more difficult. Not being able to get the help that all of us deserve can make us feel neglected and alone. These negative feelings can easily turn into negative behaviors which in turn affect every aspect of our lives. This is a problem any one of us can face and there needs to be a place where we can all get help if we donâ€™t have the privilege to pay for it.

## Solution

SafeSpace gives its users a safe space where they can tell their stories anonymously and communicate with other survivors. This way survivors no longer have to trade their anonymity for support.

## Key Technical Challenge

To make the UI appealing, thoughtful, and positive for users even though the content is revolving around traumas.

## Extension Opportunities

Add messaging features with translations, add translation features on posts, check-ins for users.
